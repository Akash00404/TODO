### How to Run

1.  **Clone the Repository (or download files):**
    If you're using Git, clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

    Alternatively, you can download the `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` files directly.

2.  **Open `index.html`:**
    Navigate to the directory where you saved the files and open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/todo-app
    open index.html
    ```

    (On Windows, you might double-click the `index.html` file.)
